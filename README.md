# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
The goal was to build a good machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. This is a supervised learning problem, as we have labeled data indicating credit card approval. The target variable is a binary classification of whether the credit card application is approved or not.
