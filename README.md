# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
The goal was to build a good machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. This is a supervised learning problem, as we have labeled data indicating credit card approval. The target variable is a binary classification of whether the credit card application is approved or not.

# About the Dataset
The dataset chosen is the "Credit Approval" dataset, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I chose this dataset because it is a classic and well-known dataset in the field of credit risk analysis. It contains information about credit card applications, and the goal is to predict whether a given application will be approved or not. Since this dataset concerns credit card applications, all attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data.

The dataset contains 15 features including the credit card's age, gender, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, and credit score. The dataset contains 690 rows and 15 columns. The target variable is a binary classification of whether the credit card application is approved or not. The dataset was first published in 1994, and it was last updated in 1996.

The dataset was collected by a Taiwanese bank between 1987 and 1990. The bank was interested in developing a system to automatically approve or reject credit card applications. The dataset includes a mix of both numerical and categorical data, and some features have missing values.

# About the Classifier used
The decision tree classifier was a good choice according to me for resolving this problem since it is capable of handling both category and numerical data, both of which are included in the credit card approval dataset. Furthermore, decision trees are simple to read and explain, which is critical for anticipating credit card approvals. The decision tree may also uncover crucial traits that contribute the most to the target variable, which can be useful in discovering critical aspects that impact people's chances of obtaining credit cards accepted.
